 abstract = {Having a great potential to increase the capacity of Device-to-Device (D2D) communications and alleviate the interference of cellular communications, relay aided D2D communications have attracted increasing attentions. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of relay aided D2D communications, in which D2D users reuse the resource of cellular uplink transmissions. For better coexistence of D2D and cellular communications, an outage probability (OP) constraint is adopted to protect cellular communications from excessive performance degradation. With the derived OP interference constraint, a power allocation scheme is formulated, in which the SE of relay aided D2D communications is to be maximized while the EE requirement is guaranteed. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme and reveal the impacts of system parameters such as the EE threshold, the OP threshold, and the location of the relay user on the SE of relay aided D2D communications.},
