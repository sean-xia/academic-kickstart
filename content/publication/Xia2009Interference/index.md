abstract = "We investigate the generation of two-mode-entangled light from a laser-driven three-level V -type atom inside a cavity by taking into account spontaneously generated quantum interference between two atomic decay channels. We show that under some conditions, the system can reduce to a nondegenerate parametric amplifier which is responsible for the entanglement between the two cavity modes. Compared to the case without the quantum interference, it is found that the entanglement of the cavity field can be significantly enhanced by the interference when the relative phase of the two pumping lasers δϕ=π ."
