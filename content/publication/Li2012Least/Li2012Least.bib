 abstract = {Beamforming with sparse constraint has shown significant performance improvement. In this letter, a least squares constant modulus blind adaptive beamforming with sparse constraint is proposed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach exhibits better performance than the well-known least squares constant modulus algorithm (LSCMA).},
