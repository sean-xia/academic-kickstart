 abstract = {We consider the wireless powered communications where users harvest energy from non-dedicated sources. The user follows a harvest-then-transmit protocol: in the first phase of a slot time, the source node harvests energy from a nearby conventional access point, then transmits information to its destination node or relay node in the second phase. We obtain the optimal harvesting ratio to maximize the expected throughput for direct transmission (DT) and decode forward (DF) relay under outage constraint, respectively. Our results reveal that the optimal harvest ratio for DT is dominated by the outage constraint while for DF relay, by the data causality.},
