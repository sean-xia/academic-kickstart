 abstract = {With rapid development of VLSI,Low Density Parity Check Code(LDPC) is adopted by DVB organization as most effective and easy to implement error control method used in the next generation Digital Video Broadcasting Standard(DVBS2)鈥瞫 channel coding system.The Irregular Repeat Accumulate(IRA) encoding algorithm of LDPC code used in DVBS2 standard is researched,the generator matrix鈥瞫 characteristic and general encoding process are discussed,software of the algorithm in C language and performance simulation are implemented.The simulation result shows the LDPC code has perfect error correction ability under very low SNR in AWGN channel.},
