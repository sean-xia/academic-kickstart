abstract={Primary user detection is the key enabling technology in cognitive radio. In this paper, a spectral entropy based detection method is proposed. More specifically, when primary user is active, the received signal of secondary user will have less spectral complexity than other times, which is measured by spectral entropy. The presence of primary user can be examined by comparing the estimated spectral entropy of signal to a threshold. Simulation results show that the proposed detection algorithm can achieve good performance in very low SNR environments. Moreover it dose not need any prior knowledge of primary signal and noise energy level.},

abstract={We consider the wireless powered communications where users harvest energy from non-dedicated sources. The user follows a harvest-then-transmit protocol: in the first phase of a slot time, the source node harvests energy from a nearby conventional access point, then transmits information to its destination node or relay node in the second phase. We obtain the optimal harvesting ratio to maximize the expected throughput for direct transmission (DT) and decode forward (DF) relay under outage constraint, respectively. Our results reveal that the optimal harvest ratio for DT is dominated by the outage constraint while for DF relay, by the data causality.},

abstract={Cooperative spectrum sensing is a fast and effective approach to improve sensing performance in cognitive radio networks. However, in order to reduce the bandwidth demands of cooperation, censoring is needed. In this paper, we propose a Two-Round Cooperation based Spectrum Sensing algorithm (TRCSS) according to local three-threshold decision results. More specifically, after the first round censoring failed, cognitive users begin to report the second local decision bits to fusion center to proceed the second round cooperation, thus sensing failure is eliminated. Furthermore, integrating uncertainty of noise variance, we propose a simple method to set local decision threshold values. Numerical results show that TRCSS algorithm does not significantly increase the number of sensing bits, especially with much cooperative users. In addition, the complementary ROC curves demonstrate that the TRCSS algorithm is superior to the conventional double-threshold sensing methods in performance.},

abstract={Small cell networks offer a promising and viable approach to meeting the increasing demand for high-data-rate wireless applications. With the expected increase in the number of small cell deployments, energy efficiency (EE) is a crucial system design parameter that demands consideration from an eco-sustainability perspective. One way to improve EE is to switch off small cell base stations (BSs) or to keep them in energy-saving mode while preserving the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users. With “bits/joule” as the metric, we aim to optimize EE with the introduction of several levels of sleep depths. Using a stochastic geometry-based heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) model, we derive coverage probability, average achievable rate, and EE in heterogeneous K-tier wireless networks with different sleep modes for small cells. Then, we try to maximize EE under 1) a random sleeping policy and 2) a strategic sleeping policy, with constraints on both coverage probability and wake-up times. Due to the nonconvexity of EE, we propose an alternative low-complexity near-optimal solution by maximizing the lower bound of EE. We use an alternating iterative approach to solve the resulting multivariable optimization problem. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the scheme. With improvements of approximately 30% in EE with random sleeping policy, simulation indicates that instantaneous EE can be further improved by 15% with a strategic sleeping policy.},

abstract={Having a great potential to increase the capacity of Device-to-Device (D2D) communications and alleviate the interference of cellular communications, relay aided D2D communications have attracted increasing attentions. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of relay aided D2D communications, in which D2D users reuse the resource of cellular uplink transmissions. For better coexistence of D2D and cellular communications, an outage probability (OP) constraint is adopted to protect cellular communications from excessive performance degradation. With the derived OP interference constraint, a power allocation scheme is formulated, in which the SE of relay aided D2D communications is to be maximized while the EE requirement is guaranteed. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme and reveal the impacts of system parameters such as the EE threshold, the OP threshold, and the location of the relay user on the SE of relay aided D2D communications.},

abstract={In this paper, a joint time allocation and power splitting (JTAPS) scheme is considered for the decode- and-forward (DF) energy harvesting (EH) relaying network, where the ``harvest-then-forward" strategy is employed. We focus on designing an optimal JTAPS scheme to conduct the relay under statistical/instantaneous channel state information (CSI) in terms of outage performance. For the statistical CSI, the expressions of the outage probability and outage capacity are derived to determine the optimal power splitting (PS) ratio and time allocation (TA) ratio. For the instantaneous CSI, a joint PS ratio and TA ratio optimization problem is formulated to minimize the outage probability. Considering that the optimization problem is non- convex, a split-step iterative method is proposed to obtain the optimal PS ratio and TA ratio. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the advantage of JTAPS scheme with respect to the outage performance.},

abstract={Self-similar repetitive patterns inside natural images are widely exploited for various image recovery tasks such as image denoising, image deblurring, and single image super-resolution (SISR). In this paper, we present a two-stage self-similarity learning-based SISR method by gradually magnifying an input low-resolution (LR) image to the desired HR one. In the first stage, the one-pass algorithm is applied to improve the compatibilities between neighboring high-resolution (HR) patches and local neighbor regression (LNR) is used to establish the mapping relationship from the LR to HR image patches. In the second one, we further boost up the quality of the LNR-based result by incorporating a fast non-local means (NLM) based regularization term into the reconstruction-based SISR framework. Experiments indicate that the proposed method is able to yield state-of-art SR performance without relying on any external exemplars.},

abstract={Simultaneous information and energy transfer (SIET) is attracting much attention as an effective method to provide green energy supply for mobiles. However, low power level of harvested energy from RF spectrum limits application of this technique. Thanks to improvement of sensitivity and efficiency of RF energy harvesting circuit as well as dense deployment of small cell base stations, SIET becomes more practical. In this paper, we propose a unified receiver model for SIET in LTE-A small cell base station networks, formulate a feasibility problem with Poisson point process model and analyze the feasibility for a special and practical scenario. The results show that it is feasible for mobiles to charge the secondary battery with harvested energy from BSs, but it is still impractical to directly charge the primary battery or operate without any battery at all.},
